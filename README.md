## Overview

This repository contains the interview task for the WerkStudent position in Python. The goal is to collect data from three sample invoices, create an Excel file with two sheets, and generate a CSV file. Additionally, an executable file should be provided to run the code.

## Task Details

1. **Data Extraction**:
    - Extract specific values from three sample invoices.
    - For Sample 1, extract the value shown in the provided image.

    - For Samples 2 and 3, extract the value shown in the provided image.

2. **Excel File Creation**:
    - Create an Excel file with two sheets:
        - **Sheet 1**: Contains three columns - File Name, Date (scraped from the document), and Value.
        - **Sheet 2**: Contains a pivot table with the date and value sum, and also by document name.

3. **CSV File Creation**:
    - Create a CSV file with all the data, including headers, and use a semicolon (;) as the separator.

4. **Executable File**:
    - Provide an executable file (.exe) that can run the code if the files are in the same folder.

5. **Branch Creation**:
    - Create a branch in this repository named `LastName_FirstName` (e.g., `Shovon_Golam`).
    - Upload your code to this branch. No need to submit a pull request; the branch will be checked directly.

6. **Documentation**:
    - Include an explanation in the README file that a non-technical person can understand.
    - Ensure the code is documented so that a technical person can understand it.

7. **Problem Reporting**:
    - If you face any problems or find it impossible to complete a task, document the issue in the README file of your branch. Explain what the problem was and why you were unable to complete it.


## How It Works

1. **Data Extraction**:
    - The script reads the sample invoices and extracts the required values.
    - The extracted data is stored in variables for further processing.

2. **Excel File Creation**:
    - The script creates an Excel file with two sheets.
    - Sheet 1 contains the file name, extracted data, and value.
    - Sheet 2 contains a pivot table summarizing the data by date and document name.

3. **CSV File Creation**:
    - The script generates a CSV file with the extracted data, including headers, and uses a semicolon as the separator.

4. **Executable File**:
    - An executable file is provided to run the entire code. Ensure the sample invoices are in the same folder as the executable file.

5. **Requirements File**:
    -A requirements.txt file is included to create the environment needed to run the code

## Running the Code

1. Place the sample invoices in the same folder as the executable file.
2. Run the executable file to execute the code and generate the Excel and CSV files.


## Documentation

- The README file contains a non-technical explanation of the code.
- The code is documented with comments to help technical users understand its functionality.

## Problem Reporting

- If you face any problems or find it impossible to complete a task, document the issue in the README file of your branch. Explain what the problem was and why you were unable to complete it.

## Timeline

- The timeline for this task is one week (7 days, not only working days) from the day you received the task.
